Adding a new block

1. Make the class, extend Block for a blank slate or extend Block____ to use a preexisting block as a base



Registering the block

1. In init.ModBlocks add the following where it fits alphabetically

   public static final BlockName BLOCK_NAME = null;

   replacing BlockName and BLOCK_NAME with the relevant names

2. In EventSubscriber you need to add the block under registerBlocks and registerItems

3. In registerBlocks, add the following to the array "blocks"

   RegistryUtil.setBlockName(new BlockName(), "block_name"),

   replacing BlockName and "block_name" with the relevant names

4. In registerItems, add the following to the array "itemBlocks" NOT "items"

   new ItemBlock(ModBlocks.BLOCK_NAME).setRegistryName(ModBlocks.BLOCK_NAME.getRegistryName()),

   replacing BLOCK_NAME with the relevant name
