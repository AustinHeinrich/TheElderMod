Adding a new block

1. Make the class, extend Block for a blank slate



Registering the block

1. In init.ModBlocks add the following where it fits alphabetically

   public static final BlockName BLOCK_NAME = null;

   replacing BlockName and BLOCK_NAME with the relevant names

2. In EventSubscriber you need to add the block under registerBlocks and registerItems

3. In registerBlocks, add the following to the array "blocks"

   RegistryUtil.setBlockName(new BlockName(), "block_name"),

   replacing BlockName and "block_name" with the relevant names

4. In registerItems, add the following to the array "itemBlocks" NOT "items"

   new ItemBlock(ModBlocks.BLOCK_NAME).setRegistryName(ModBlocks.BLOCK_NAME.getRegistryName()),

   replacing BLOCK_NAME with the relevant name

Giving the block textures

1. In resources/assets/eldermod/models/block, add a .json for your new block following the format of the other blocks
    Do the same for resources/assets/eldermod/models/blockstates

    You can find names for vanilla textures and example .json files at: https://mcasset.cloud/1.12.2/assets/minecraft

2. add the block to /assets/models/item following the same convention
