===============

*Otherwise: The Elder for someone who has never played Minecraft or even video games at all.*

#### To launch the Elder (Beta)

##### Required: 
- A copy of Minecraft Java Edition (https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-java-edition/)
- Minecraft Forge 1.12.2 Version 2768 (https://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.12.2.html)
	- Version 2786 is the RECOMMENDED version, rather than the latest
	
##### Configuring the Minecraft Launcher:
1) After opening the Minecraft Launcher, navigate to the Installations tab.

2) Select "New..." at the top

3) Under "Version", navigate to 1.12.2-forge1.12.2-14.23.5.2768, select it and press create.

4) Navigate back to the Play tab, ensuring the file you just selected is displayed in the bottom left.

5) Click "Play" at the bottom to launch.

6) Exit out of game and download our "eldermod-beta.jar".

7) Place the .jar file in the C:\Users\{USER}\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\mods folder (for Windows).

##### Once in Game:
1) Launch the game and ensure it is installed by checking the "Mods" tab in game. Alternatively, you may have seen "5 mods loaded" displayed somewhere, which also ensures the mod is installed properly.

2) Select "Singleplayer", then "Create New World", change "Game Mode" to "Creative" by clicking the button twice, and press "Create World".

3) Double tap the space bar to fly, and fly upwards a few meters.

4) Press the "e" key to open the inventory and press the rightward arrow in the top-right of this menu.

5) Click on the book tab, which is titled "The Elder" on scroll-over.

6) This is a custom tab, which brings up all of our custom items and blocks. Many do not yet have textures.

7) Select the blue orb, titled "Elder Dimenstion Teleporter", and place it in the hotbar.

8) Exit the inventory menu by pressing "e" once more, and select the Elder Dimension Teleporter. When it is selected, right-click to teleport.

9) Observe the Elder Dimension by flying around, breaking blocks by left-clicking, etc.

##### Some notes:
- If you are in Survival mode (by pressing "t" and typing /gamemode survival), at night (/time set night or after ~10 minutes) the Elder will damage you. This can be avoided by using one of our structures.

- The mobs (the giant squirming creatures that just disappear/die) do not yet have AI.

- Some structures may load without textures, because those blocks do not yet have textures.

- By pressing "F3" you can bring up an information screen. Particularly, in the bottom right it displays the block you are looking at. You may also see coordinates ("XYZ:") and your current environment ("Biome:").
