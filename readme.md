Steps to run *the Elder*:
1) Run copy of Minecraft with Forge installed to generate forge files within 
your .minecraft folder.

1.1) To do this, after opening the Minecraft Launcher, navigate to the "Installations"
tab and select "New...". In the "VERSION" drop-down menu navigate to "release
forge 1.12.2-forge1.12.2-14.23.5.2768", select it and create your install. Ensure
this installation is selected and press "Play".

2) In your .minecraft folder (default path (windows): C:\Users\{USER}\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft)
navigate to the 'mods' directory. If it was not generated when Minecraft launched,
create a mods directory.

3) Download the_elder_0.2.jar from this repository and install it in the mod
directory. 

4) Launch Minecraft. After launching, ensure "The Elder" is loaded in the mod 
menu on the main screen.

5) After this, go to Singleplayer and Create a New World. Set the Game Mode to 
Creative.

6) Once loaded into the world, press 'e' to open the creative menu. At the top
right press the right arrow button to see our custom "The Elder" creative menu
tab and two "Hello World"-eqsue blocks, which serve as basic initial tests.
